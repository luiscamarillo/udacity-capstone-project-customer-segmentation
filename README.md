# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Capstone Project

# Customer Segmentation Report and Model for Arvato Financial Solutions

This is the Capstone Project of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree, working with data provided by Arvato Financial Solutions, a Bertelsmann subsidiary.
The project is focused with helping a mail-order sales company in Germany interested in identifying segments of the general population to target with their marketing in order to grow. To do this, the project utilizes datasets with demographics from both the general population of Germany as well as customers of the mail-order company. The objective is to use this data to build a model, using both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, that identifies which individuals are most likely to become customers of the mail-order company.

## Installations
The jupyter notebook with the original data wrangling steps can be installed through anaconda and was written in python 3.10.4.

Libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- collections
- imblearn
- xgboost

The data was provided by Arvato Financial Solutions, a Bertelsmann subsidiary, and is not available in this repository due to confidentiality requirements.

## Project Motivation

This project allowed me to practice every step in the data science pipeline, from data analysis and visualization, to data cleaning and preparation, to modeling utilizing both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. In addition, as an actual business problem, writing this report was a great exercise in analyzing real data and results, and providing clear technical context and conclusions.

## Results & Improvements

The project report can be found in the Report_UdacityCapstoneProject pdf find available in this repository, going into detail of the results and the following steps:
- Explore and visualize the demographics data available for the general population and existing customers.
- Clean, transform, and prepare the data for modeling.
- Perform unsupervised learning techniques to cluster the data into customer segments.
- Analyze customer segments to describe the relationship between the demographics of the company's existing customers and the general population.
- Build a prediction model with supervised learning techniques targeting customers for a mail-out campaign.
- Iterate and refine the model by trying different algorithms and using cross-validation.
- Evaluate and validate the final modelâ€™s performance.
